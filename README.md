# VHDL-Debug-UART
A UART that prints 10 hex bytes from anywhere you choose in your CPLD/FPGA
This can be useful to show signals and pin values without having to resort to logic analysers and scopes. And is always there when you may need it. 
It's submitted as a Gowin project for the Tang Nano. The Tang Nano ships with Claire Wolf’s great design.
I developed the code with Lattice and their version of ModelSim using their IP builder. As it turned out Gowins FIFO IP seems to be compatible. Gowin could help themselves by offering ModelSim on their IDE which apart from the simulation aspect looks great. The Tang Nano for the cost and number if LUT’s and resources is pretty amazing

This is my first post to a repository as I’m recently retired so have some free time to dabble and do some designing just for the fun of it.
